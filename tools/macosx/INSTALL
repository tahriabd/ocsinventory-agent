[REVIEW README FIRST]

- Unzip unified_unix_agent-macosx-XXXXX.zip into a temporary directory (eg: /Users/$ROB$/tmp/)
- Open up a terminal window
- cd to the the temp directory:

	$> cd unified_unix_agent-macosx.../

- Replace the file: cacert.pem with your own local version (if you're using a self-signed ssl cert for package deployment)
- run:
	sh ./scripts/create_install_wrapper.sh

This will create a deployable install_wrapper.sh script (with the agent archive embedded into it) that can be remotely deployed to hosts via ssh. See install_wrapper.sh -h for more usage info.

The install_wrapper.sh:

- Unzips the embedded agent
- creates the local config
- triggers the ./scripts/installer.sh 

The installer.sh:

- install OCSNG.app to /Applications/OCSNG.app
- copy the config file to /etc/ocsinventory
- install a startup plist file to launchd
- install ocsng.log to /var/log (viewable via the console utility)
- call launchd to start the service

For custom deployment (e.g including your own configuration), you have to launch installer.sh qs is :
	installer.sh -custom

Assuming you don't see any errors, you should be able to open up the console utility and view the /var/logs/ocsng.log file to verify the service started properly.

Once installed, the agent should contact the server and upload an initial inventory, then go back to sleep.

Notes:

- OCS agent is launched using LaunchD but you can click on /Applications/OCSNG.app to launch OCS agent manually.
- To uninstall the .app, use the uninstaller.sh script. This will kill the service, remove all the files (no restart required).
