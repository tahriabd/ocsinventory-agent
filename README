DESCRIPTION

  Ocsinventory-Agent is an agent for ocsinventory NG. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress.
  

PREREQUISITES

  Perl 5.8.
  The following modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5

    XML::Simple

    Net::IP: optional, it is only needed to compute the network information

    LWP

    dmidecode on Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.

    lspci on Linux and *BSD (pciutils package) is required to list PCI devices.

    Mac::SysProfile 0.0.3 is need on MacOSX to collect the device informations.

    sneep on Solaris/sparc, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it :
                  (download it from http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)

 
  The following modules are optional:

    Proc::Daemon Daemon mode

    Proc::PID::File brings the pid file support if Proc::Daemon is installed

    ipmitool if you want to collect information about IPMI

    Compress::Zlib needed for OCS server prior 1.02

    To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
      - monitor-edid from Mandriva is needed to fetch the monitor. A package is available
        in Fedora repository.
        information http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Tools/monitor-edid
      - get-edid from the read-edid package

    If available, Net::CUPS is used to detect the printer

    Net::SNMP to scan network devices using SNMP    

    Nmap (v3.90 or superior) and Nmap::Parser to scan network devices for Ipdiscover


  The following module is needed if you plan to prepare a tarball or install
  directly from the Bazaar devel branch. (See SOURCES below.):

    Module::Install (Ubuntu package libmodule-install-perl). 

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  If you want to turn of the interactive post install script, just do
       PERL_AUTOINSTALL=1 perl Makefile.PL
  instead of the 
       perl Makefile.PL

  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory. In this case, use
  the --devlib flag to load the library from the local directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings.

   mkdir -p /etc/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/lib/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/log/ocsinventory-agent
   mkdir -p /var/run

  you can choose other directories by changing the default settings
  directly in the ocsinventory-agent file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: ocsinventory-agent -l /tmp --debug

  It's also possible to run directly from the tarball directory:

   sudo ./ocsinventory-agent --devlib --server http://foo/ocsinventory

PATCHES
  If you want to improve OCS Inventory, please use the Bazaar branch
  directly, publish you changes and ask for the merge
  http://wiki.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php/Developers:Bazaar

  The source of the agent can be download with this command:

  bzr branch lp:ocsinventory-unix-agent

  /!\ You may need bzr-loom plugin to retrieve the branch /!\ 


NOTE
 
 Solaris:
  Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
  The generated Makefile needs gmake to be exectuted
  The default installation will install the binary in /usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin,
  set you $PATH variable according to that.

 Crontab:
  If you use the crontab to launch the agent you'll probably have to redefine
  the PATH. For example, just add something like:
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  At the begining of the cron file.


SOURCES
You can prepare a tarball from the Bazaar devel branch with following commands:
   bzr branch lp:ocsinventory-unix-agent
   cd ocsinventory-unix-agent 
   perl Makefile.PL
   make manifest
   make dist
